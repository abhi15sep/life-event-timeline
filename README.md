- Add ability for people to pick their own colors (maybe generate a cute visual key depending on selections?)
- Handle Milestones over date ranges
- Handle Milestones outside of date ranges

## Make code better TODO
- Make the code look like "table-like" react where all the things are just tags in the view

## Everything Else
- Add demo image without personal data
- Create Today Line or cute dot
- Allow for user input
- Allow for end users to pick types of events to add
- Add hover details and elipsees for long event names
- Make visual a downloadable high res image (ideally an SVG)
