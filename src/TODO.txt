//TODO

// Add in the ability for people to enter in data and submit to render
// Add ability for people to pick their own colors (maybe generate a cute visual key depending on selections?)
// Create Today Line or cute dot
// Handle Milestones over date ranges
// Make the code look like "table-like" react where all the things are just tags in the view


// DONE

// Colors in data correspond to data type and render nicely
// Make margins be correct to show time YEAH BOIIIIII
// Fix algorithum so that it actually loops through all the things correctly DONE
// Make it so somehow dates wrap between rows (maybe not actually that bad) DONE
// Move date functions to their own file (make them suck less, potentially) DONE
// Dealt with the concept of "present" end date DONE
